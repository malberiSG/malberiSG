- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Mark Alberi Owner of SoftGlue, Software Tools & Virtual Network Compamy with GitHud Id @malberiSG
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in supplying GitHub Visual Powershell & Visual C compiliers support tools & to expand the support GitHub script applications. 

This is possible for two reasons. One SoftGlue wrote a basic complete object orientated windows forms object powershell compiler & uses a patentable RAM memory allocated space threaded script within the powershell console. The visual powershell compiler does not require powershell console administration access to run. It is a complete indexed, full focul control Powershell Development Kit or PDK that runs in a complete Powershell Runtime Environment or PRE loading all functions from all scripts loaded in that allocated memory. hereby linking them all together much like a JSON does within a command console. However, unlike a JSON thread, the visual  powershell memory thread is completely OS kernel safe because it uses a patent able powershell script within a powewrshell console memory space. Two, SoftGlue as propitiatory patentable ANSI text file embeder tool into visual basic, VB2022 .net. It can embedded any text file script or not into VB22.net allowing the VB2022.net application to redeploy on the client that script into the safe client ProgramData folder, running that deployed script, then deleting the working script & all its folders form disk. Only the executable with that embedded script remains on server disk & the client is clean of any runtime script files or complete script applications, such as GitHub.
Visual C is not yet developed. With funding its transposed visual powershell binary compiler to augment C++ and Visual basic as third complete compiler that will run in powershell with the powershell RAM memory thread the same as visual powershell now does & visual powershell will be expanded to support all windows forms objects that are currently supported by the modern 64-bit OS.
This is what SoftGlue is about. If funding is approved and rights to develop and market all its application offerings including visual powershell & visual C, scripts like java script will be much safer to deploy across a remote TCP/ IP protocol.

I more than invite GitHub to verify all that is stated here with Microsoft. They are completely aware of my proposed new development tools technology. Also, anyone can download a free 30 day trial of any or all of the nine applications offered on the SoftGlue website, SoftGlue.net as a registered logged in user guest. To see for yourselves.download specifically the Visual Powershell Compiler Demo with over 6000 lines of VB embedded powershell code, Web Links a Visual Powershell applet with over 4600 lines of VB embedded powershell code, much like a C sharp is for C & the Embedded Syntax Translator or EST. GitHub will find that it can embed a complete GITHub repository of any kind including PHP etc into VB22.net or even VB6.net then use VB to redeploy that repository anywhere they want. However. SoftGlue only supports deployment of scripts into the ProgramData folder and in the final licensing of the EST, that's where any third part including GitHub will have to deploy any and all redeployed runtime embedded scripts.
