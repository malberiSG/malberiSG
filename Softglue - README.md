- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Mark Alberi Owner of SoftGlue, Software Tools & Virtual Network Compamy with GitHud Id @malberiSG
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in supplying GitHub Visual Powershell & Visual C compiliers support tools & to expand the support GitHub script applications. 

This is possible for two reasons. One SoftGlue wrote a basic complete object orientated windows forms object powershell compiler which its compelte repository can easily be embedded into a complete vb.net compiled executable with the softglue license-able Embedded Syntax Translater or EST & uses a patentable RAM memory allocated space threaded script within the powershell console. The EST is generral purpose ant text file of standard fonting VB.net embedding development tool. The visual powershell compiler does not require powershell console administration access to run. It is a complete indexed, full focus control Powershell Development Kit or PDK that runs in a complete Powershell Runtime Environment or PRE loading all functions from all scripts loaded in that allocated memory and upholding all OS objects focus environments. Hereby, linking them all together much like a JSON does within a command console. However, unlike a JSON thread, the visual powershell memory thread is completely OS kernel safe because it uses a patentable powershell script within a powewrshell console memory space; and it is not a JSON file at all in syntax or with its file extension name. Its powershell Standard Notation or PSON that reserves powershell console memory space for all files called form a single root folder or repository as a special powershell manifest and powershell script module & so it does not have the file system security porblem a command line console PSON can unless the script application it reserves RAM memory is a secure space by the rules of PSON javasctipt applications deployment. This is why its completely OS kernel RAM, memory safe as security socket layer buffer of C and the C wscript interpreter kernels. Two, SoftGlue as propitiatory patentable ANSI text file embeder tool into visual basic, VB2022.net. It can embedded any text file script or not into VB2022.net allowing the VB2022.net application to redeploy on the client that script into the safe client ProgramData folder, running that deployed script, then deleting the working script & all its folders form disk. Only the executable with that embedded script remains on server disk & the client is clean of any runtime script files or complete script applications, such as GitHub. Visual C is not yet developed. With funding its transposed visual powershell binary compiler to augment C++ and visual basic as third complete compiler that will run in powershell with the powershell RAM memory thread the same as visual powershell now does & visual powershell will be expanded to support all windows forms objects that are currently supported by the modern 64-bit OS.

This is what SoftGlue is about. If funding is approved and rights to develop and market all its application offerings including visual powershell & visual C, scripts like java script will be much safer to deploy across a remote TCP/ IP protocol.

I more than invite GitHub to verify all that is stated here with Microsoft. They are completely aware of my proposed new development tools technology. Also, anyone can download a free 30 day trial of any or all of the nine applications offered on the SoftGlue website, SoftGlue.net as a registered logged in user guest. To see for yourselves.download specifically the Visual Powershell Compiler Demo with over 6000 lines of VB embedded powershell code, Web Links a Visual Powershell applet with over 4600 lines of VB embedded powershell code, much like a C sharp is for C & the Embedded Syntax Translator or EST. GitHub will find that it can embed a complete GITHub repository of any kind including PHP etc into VB22.net or even VB6.net then use VB to redeploy that repository anywhere they want. However. SoftGlue only supports deployment of scripts into the ProgramData folder and in the final licensing of the EST, that's where any third part including GitHub will have to deploy any and all redeployed runtime embedded scripts.

There many other new SoftGlue software tools security technology devlopments as well & are apart of all softglue.net downloads. They are all part of both the secutity instalation MSIs and the excutables binding to the full file system application root directory through the registry runtime security and DevOp automation of all applications offered. What's listed here is the core company's business model; new C syntax compiliers and its basic technology support.

inshort, Visual Powershell translated as powershell console Visual C inconjunction with the Embedded Systax Translater will expand C languages deployment with better security for all.

Please visit softglue.net the comets & Contact page. these page applet applications are a single GitHub artecture page that contains all CSS, HTML and javascript to make thse a compelte single HTM file embedded into the deployed web page by its name Comments or Contact. The web site itself has several single htm page GitHub artecture enhancements to mae th website a better user visitor and maintance experence.
